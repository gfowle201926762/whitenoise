            <p class="mt-5 lead">Hello, my name is Gus and this is a social media website which I created using the Django framework, and deployed using the Heroku platform.
            I made this for my own enjoyment and to learn more about web development. To take a look at the code, visit my github repository <a href="https://github.com/gfowle201926762/whitenoise">here</a>.
            Please feel free to register, take a look around, and send  any suggestion to me via GitHub.
            There will be more updates coming soon to facilitate people looking to join classrooms in order to learn languages together,
            instant messaging, and fancy frontend features using the React library.</p>
